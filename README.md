Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰
Welcome to the Fun Calculator! This simple Python program allows you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbersâ€”with support for decimal numbers tooâ€”making math fun and easy! ðŸ˜Žâœ¨

Features
Takes two numbers as input with decimal support (float numbers).

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Outputs results clearly and neatly.

Simple, beginner-friendly, and playful code comments to make learning fun.

How It Works
Input: The user is asked to enter two numbers. Using float() ensures decimal numbers are supported.

Calculation: The program calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

Output: The results of each operation are displayed on the screen in a friendly way.

Note: The program assumes the user does not divide by zero to avoid errors.

Usage
Run the script, then:

Enter the first number (can be a decimal).

Enter the second number (can be a decimal).

The program outputs:

The sum of the two numbers

The difference (first minus second)

The product of the two numbers

The quotient (first divided by second)

Example:

text
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
Code Explanation
The program uses float inputs for flexibility with decimal numbers.

Arithmetic is done with Python's standard operators: +, -, *, /.

Results are printed using formatted strings for readability.

The code includes fun comments and emojis to keep it engaging!

Possible Improvements
Add error handling for division by zero.

Allow the user to select which operation to perform.

Implement a loop for multiple calculations without restarting the program.
